# central-blinds-management

Hi, 
My name is Bruno Lemos, 
I consider myself as a JÃºnior Programmer.

And to finish my Vocational Course of Technical Management and Programming Information Systems,
I had to develop a project and I (with the advisory and help from a teacher of mine) came up with this project I'm presenting here.

The Central Blinds Management.

This is a simple system that with a Raspberry Pi, some connections and some ESP8266, 
We can remotely open and close the eletric blinds of an house.

Any question just ask here, or just send me an email for : brunomina1997@hotmail.com
I will try to answer everything !
